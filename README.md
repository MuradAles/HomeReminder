The basics of running our application involve having Node.js, and MongoDB. Node.js can be downloaded from their offical website, and the community server of mongoDB is sufficient for our program.
Use the default connection for MongoDB in MongoDB Compass.
When running our project, navigate into the file directory and open two separate terminals: One for frontend and one for backend.
For the backend one, navigate into the backend directory, and use "npm i" to install needed packages, followed by "npm start" to run the backend server.
For the frontend one, navigate into the frontend directory, and use "npm i" to install needed packages, followed by "npm start" to run the frontend server.
